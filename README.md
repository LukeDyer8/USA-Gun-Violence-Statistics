# Gun Violence Insights

## Overview

Welcome to the "Gun Violence Insights" repository, a project developed as part of a Decision Support System class. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of gun violence statistics in the United States, leveraging advanced data processing, visualization, and analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights. Whether you're a student, researcher, or data enthusiast, this repository offers a wealth of information and tools for understanding and addressing the complexities of gun violence.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Processing

The repository includes a robust data processing pipeline designed to clean, validate, and organize raw gun violence data. Using a data set off Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jameslko/gun-violence-data?resource=download&select=gun-violence-data_01-2013_03-2018.csv.

### 2. Visualization

Experience the power of interactive visualizations crafted using cutting-edge tools and libraries. Dive into graphical representations that highlight spatial and temporal patterns, providing a nuanced understanding of the dynamics surrounding gun violence.

### 3. Decision Support System

Interact with a user-friendly decision support interface, allowing stakeholders to explore the data and extract relevant insights. Machine learning algorithms are implemented for predictive modeling and scenario analysis, providing a forward-looking perspective on gun violence trends.

# Project Background

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This project is the outcome of my first attempt at data analytics, a journey that unfolded during my participation in a Decision Support Systems class. In this course, I explored the powerful intersection of decision-making and data, delving into techniques to process, visualize, and derive insights from complex datasets.

The analysis of gun violence statistics in the United States presented a unique opportunity to apply the principles learned in the classroom to a real-world scenario. As a learner in the field, I embraced the challenge, navigated through various methodologies, and sought to contribute meaningfully to the discourse surrounding gun violence.

This project not only reflects my dedication to learning but also serves as a testament to the educational experience provided by the Decision Support Systems class. I'm excited to share my findings, and I welcome feedback  from the community to continue this learning journey together.
