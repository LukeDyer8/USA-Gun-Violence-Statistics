# Methodology

In our methodology, we specifically adopted a predictive approach to address the issue of gun violence. By utilizing clustering techniques, we aimed to segment geographical areas experiencing high incidences of gun violence. This strategy allowed us to discern and categorize these regions based on shared characteristics, enabling a focused analysis to pinpoint the particular nuances and complexities of gun-related problems within each cluster.

The algorithms we applied were `SimpleKMeans` and `MakeDensityBasedCluster`. We selected these algorithms to focus on the geographical locations of higher cases of shootings and to differentiate between killings and injuries. The goal was to obtain information that could be cross-referenced with state gun laws to make effective policy decisions.

This approach provided valuable insights into states with higher issues, such as Illinois, California, Louisiana, and Missouri. It enables a deeper understanding of these states, prompting further investigation into their gun laws and their impact on gun-related incidents. Additionally, it revealed expected patterns, like Alaska having lower averages, emphasizing the need to consider state population to determine the percentage of gun crime relative to population size.

## Metrics Used

The metrics used in our analysis included:
- Longitude and latitude of gun violence incidents
- Number of people killed
- Number of people injured
- Date
- State
- Longitude and latitude

These metrics allowed us to build a comprehensive understanding of the geographical and human impact of gun violence incidents, forming the foundation for our insights and policy recommendations.
